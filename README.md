## What

A simple digital tool with goniometry to allow clinicians to prescribe rehab exercises and patients to self-perform and monitor recovery.

This is a progressive Web App so usable on all modern smartphones. It uses the in-built device gyroscope + magnetometer. Exercises are easily share-able via an encoded link. Gratifying visualisation for the patient have fun with their recovery.

To give patients the ability to:
- Have clear instructions for their exercises
- See their rehab progress between appointments
- Be confident that they are not over extending, risking further injury
- Able to use in any comfortable position (lying down, sitting, standing)
- Use on any modern smartphone


## Why

- Paper based measurements
- Patient is unable to measure themselves from home
- Weeks between appointments with no measurable progress reports
- No live guidance for patient when performing exercises
